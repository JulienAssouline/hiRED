hiRED
hiRED is a full stack web application that connects students with alumni mentors. There is a list of available mentors that a student can filter based on their skills, name, and program. The student can then decide whether they want to chat with the mentor and make an appointment. Students can also upload their work and projects in order to display their portfolio.

This app was made in 3 weeks with 5 other developers while I was at Red Academy. The stack we used was React, Apollo, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL.

I was in charge of making the mentors list along with the filter.

I also made the chat which uses subscriptions to send results every time a particular event happens (exp. a message).

I made the second signup form, and the form to add one's skills.

For all features, I was a part of I worked on both the frontend and backend.
